## User Story


AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Installation
    This application runs through the browser and features a
    dynamically updated HTML, Bootstrap and a touch of CSS and is all brought together to show user functionality by using JavaScript. I use a framework of JS, JQuery which also adds to the functionallity. 

## USECASE
    A basic weather forecast application that lets a user pick a particular city around the world and have the weather displayed as an icon, as well as the temperature(in fahrenheit), the windspeed, and the UV index which will show a color according to my if, if else, else statment.. If the UV is less than 5, it will be green, if the UV index is inbetween 5 and 10, it will be red, if it is greater than 10 it will be purple. A 5 day forecast will also append to the users screen in a row, which will yield a 5 day forecast with the icon of the weather, the date, the windspeed, and uv index. This application is designed to help a user figure out plans according to a 5 day forecast, so they may prepare for their week in terms of the weather..
